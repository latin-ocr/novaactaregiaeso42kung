the prehistorie crania, but exceeds that of the Upsala crania by some-

11, on the other hand„ we compare the cranium before us with

MANouvRIER„ and others„ into the cranial capacity of European 1100111οΞ
of the present dayq 111111 111 former times„ which in general vary be-
tween 1500 and 1600 cub. 0111.7 this cranium can barely be regarded
as of medium size. This is the more remarkable since the theory is
often maintained that intelligence and hrain-volume stand in immediate
connection with 0110 another, and one should thus expect 10 find that
SwEDENuoRG had a particularly large brain. and consequently a more
than usually eapacious skull. If the said theory were fully justitiable„
then the mmlerate size 01 1110 present cranium would certainly involve
an effective cause for douhting 115 1110111111, 1οΓ which reason the
question 1111151 here be briessy discussed.

The determination of the capacity of the crania of individuals
especially noted for their intelligence 11115 hitherto been undertaken
in a very few cases only. In a classifieation made in 1883 by
WELQKER 34 it was proved that in 9 out 01 11 such cases the capacity
was 1500 cub. 0111, or more„ and that only 2 crania possessed a capa-
city below the last-mentioned number. The latter were the skull 01
DANTE (1403 cub. cm.) and of the anatomist PH. ΡΒ. MECKEL (1335
cub. 0111.). The second place 111 1110 firstv category is occupied by lM.
