Rather extensive investigations have been made on this subject by
WELGKER. 34, 1115 12q and KOLLMANN 14,011 111 all more than loo bodies
of adult individuals, chiefly 01 1116 111616 sex. I have myself undertaken
similar measurements 011 6 number 01 corpses„ partly to test the correct—
ness 01 1116 5161611161115, partly because Iwished„ for the gaining 01
1111111161ὶ certainty 111 my reconstruction. to secure a greater number 01
fixed points 111611 what were used by the above-mentioned authors.
Since it has 116611 shown that sex and age, as well as wasting dis-
66565, exercise a considerable inssuence upon the thickness 01 1116 5011
116115, and this 111 varying degree 011 different parts of the 1666,16011-
sidered it 10 116 111051 exact to use only measurements derived from older
men enjoying rather ordinary nutrition. The figures given on Tab. IV.7
which Ι employed 111 my reconstruction„ thus represent for the most
part the average values calculated from the individual measurements
01 llis and KoLLMANN 01 15 corpses from 55 10 78 years 01 age and
of the male sex,

It is quite evidentff and is also proved by the original 11811165,
that those parts 01 1116 head where 1116 bony frame is covered only
by the skin and a thin layer 01 connective tissue or 1111156165, show
1116 least individua] differences. This is the case in regard 10 1116 forc-
116611, 1116 ridge of the 11056, 1116 611865 around the (1116-50611615 and the
zygomatic 6161165, 111 which places the 8166165161611161101151101111116
average in either positive or negative direction generally amount to
only 1 01· 2 mm. (in exception-al cases to 2.3 or 2.5 mm). The angle
between the septum 01 1116 11056 1111(1 1116 upper 1111, as well 65 1116
point os the 611111, 6150 have a very 6011516111 position in relation 10 1116
underlying bone: this seems also 10 116 true 01 1116 position 01 1116 wings
01 1116 11056, and7 although in a somewhat lesser degree, 01 the lower
bordei· 01 1116 inferior maxilla. In contradistinction to 11115, 11161110-
portions 01 that part of the nose supported by cartilage, and 01 the
lips and 61166115, are very variable. The 5011 parts in front 01 1116 eye—
balls likewise show relatively great variations. A reconstruction 011
1116 basis of tho average numbers referred to above must thus be more
accurate in respect to the first-named parts 01 1116 1666 111611 111 1116 6656
01 1116 last-mentioned„ where the sources 01 error are much greater.

In order to be sure„ 61 every stage 011116 11101155 1110811655,
that all the (1601611115, which might be made from an anatomical point
01 view* were fully taken into consideration, I preferred to do all 01
1116 reconstrueting entirely with my own 11111111, instead 01 relying 011
