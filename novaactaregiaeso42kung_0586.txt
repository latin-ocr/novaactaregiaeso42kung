If one furthermore takes into consideration that the size of the
cranium and the brain undoubtedly stand in a certain relation to the
size of the body„ and that SWEDENBORG'S stature, as shown above, was
rather small, and also that the cranium contained in the coffin„ in
eomparison with the older Upsala crania with which it should in the
first place be compared„ is in no wise small, but rather large, I do
not think that anything may, from a scientific point of view, be opposed
to the possibility that SWEDENBORG had a brain which could have been
contained within the compass of the skull before us.

Neither does it appear to me that the form of our cranium can
lead to any scientifically founded doubt as to its authenticity. lt is of
course a very common theory that the higher intellectu-al functions are
chiefly localized in the frontal lobe7 and it may therefore arouse a cer-
tain suspicion to see that the frontal region of the cranium is relatively
less developed than the back of the head. As, however, it is impossible
to determine on an intact cranium the boundary between the frontal
and parietal lobes of the brain, it is an utterly vain undertaking to
judge of the relative development of the different parts of the brain
from the external shape of the skull. We must unfortunately abstain
for reasons of piety from a cross-sectioning of the cranium„ which
would have made possible a study of the reliefs on the inner side.
That a high grade of intelligence is fully compatible with a relatively
feeblo development of the anterior portion of the braim-case is apparentq
among other casesq from the description by KUPFER ἃ BEsSEL HAGEN 16
of the skull of IMMANUEL KANT, whose frontal region7 as far as one is
able to judge from representations and measurements, exhibits a very
great agreement with the corresponding part of the cranium in SwE-
DENBORG'S coffin. KANT's skull„ like the one before us, is relatively
low„ but in other respects exhibits essential differences: it is consider-
ably broader and sliorten consequently more brachycephalic (Index 885),
and, as is evident from the figures furnished above„ it is more than
200 cub. cm. more capacious.

One may with quite great probability conclude from the external
relief of the tempora] region, described above on page 37, that the
third frontal gyrus of the brain was relatively well developeth especially
on the left side. It ought therefore to be mentioned that GALL locates
in this part of the brain the mechanical as well as the musical talenta
and that SwEDENnoRo. in both these respects, was richly endowed.
The whole question is as yet too uncertain„ even if the points in que-
