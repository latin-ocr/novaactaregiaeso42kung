How do the physiognomical characters of the cranium agree
with the portraits of Swedenborq‘?

To identify, with only the guidance of portraits of a deceased
person, the skull which has been his during life, is, in most cases, a
very difficult undertaking. Undoubtedly, even crania possess individual
characteristics, which may at times be very strongly marked, but on
account of the soft parts which 0101110 311 parts of the bony 1131110, and
on account of the 11311, which 0011003Ιο 3 great part of the 001110111
111100 01 1110 head, these characters are seen only in a greatly modi-
fied form in the living face, while, on 1110 011101 hand, the greater part
01 1110 details which in the 131101 0001101310 10 101111 1110 characteristic gc-
ncral image, such as the 111010 delicate features around eyes and mouth„
color tints, etc, is not at all represented in a death's-head. It is almost
exclusively the relative proportions between the different parts of the
face and the relief itself 01 1110 rather limited parts of the facial 011010-
1011, upon which the overlying 0011 113110 310 01 slight and relatively
uniform thickness, which 0311 110 1110 object of 3 direct comparison.

It is also sels-evident that in 311 investigation 01 this kind the
conclusions must, as 3 11110, be drawn with 3 00113111 reserve. Evcn
in cases where 3 fully satisfactory agreement 10 found between the
comparable characters 01 3 cranium and 3 death-inask 01 3 110111311,
one must also reckon with the possibility 01 two different individuals
having 0131113 01 precisely the 031110 type. Only in exceptional cases

tive respect, that is to say, if one can firinly establish that the pro-
portione of the given cranium and of the representation are so diffe-
rent that the former could not without violence to 1110· 3113101111031 relations
be fitted into the contours 01 1110 latter. Of course, for a conclusion 01
this kind, the absolute reliability 01 1110 representation 1111101110 guarantecd.

The comparison will, 01 course, be easicst and surest if there
