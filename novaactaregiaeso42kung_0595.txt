THE MORTAL REMAms OF SWEDENBORG 59

cially KRAFFT'S portrait seems to indicate a forehead profile which is
continued without interruption into the ridge 01 1116 11056, 11161 is, the
portrait indicates a Greek profile.

Regarding this departure it should„ liowevel‘‚ in the first place⁷
be mentioned, that in en face pictures‚ neither the degree of sloping,
and the yaulting 01 1116 1016116611Ἴ nor the depression between the fore-
head and the nose, or, on the whole, the relief conditions 01 1116 11101116,
come to a plain and correct expression, at least if the lights are not
especially suitable for this purpose„ and also that the position 01 1116 edge
of the hair, and 61611 1116 hair-dressing itself⁷ greatly inssuence our
conception 01 1116 111111611510115 01 ‘a forehead. Ι 511611 50011 have the
opportunity of showing a striking example 01 1116 1011116006 01 111656
1601015. Furthermore, it seems by no means improbable that the »Olym-
pic» arching of the forehead⁷ which is especially manifest in the copy
01 BRANDER'S porti-ait kept in the Royal Academy of Sciences, with or
without purpose has been sharply accentuated to indicate 1116 sublime
thinker 61111 5661ἲ SWEDENBORG. Evident exaggeration& just in this
(1116011011ᾖ 116 find in certain likenesses 01 SwEDENBoRG of later periods
(for instance in PREsToN PowERs' well known bust). Regarding the
Greek profile in KRAFFT'S portrait7 even this could bc a kind of »licentia
poetica». According to the esthetic conceptions of former 110165, 1116
Greek 11056 was supposed to give the impression of »freedom from
the passions»7 01 »equilibrium between intelligence and sensuality»a
traits 01 character which an artist might well desire to introduce into
his likenessjof SWEDENBORG.

What I have said may possibly be regarded 65 611 illegitimate
attempt to explain away the contradictory arguments in the (1610011-
stration. To protect myself from a charge of 11115 kind, I need only
call 10 mind the fact that the portraits can in no wise 116 regarded as
accordant 1111065565, 10111 11161, on the contrary, the last-mentioned phy-
siognomical features on respectiyely BRANDER's and KRAFFT's portraits
are much less or not at all pronounced on several 01 1116 other por-
traits, These discrepancies of course greatly reduce the 161116 01 1116
testimony furnished by each individual portrait, in respect to 11616115,
and Ι therefore do not hesitate to say that 111 general the portraits
and the cranium agree fairly well with each other.

This conclusion, however. rests chiefly upon 6 quite subjective
Valuation of similarities and differences and it 1165 therefore desir-
able to subject the question to more objective procis, which was done
