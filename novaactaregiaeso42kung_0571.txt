THE MORTAL Rmsxms or SwEDENBono 35

opened.¹ The squ-amous sutures on both sides are somewhat separated.
causing the upper edge ol' the temporal bone to protrude two or three
millimetres from the plane of the parieta] bone. All these changes are
[inquestionably 01 3 post-mortem nature: no signs have been observed
by us which could indicate any violence experienced during life, sus-
picion 01 which has been expressed (see page 24). Neither have any
changes in the skull due to disease been noticed; it ought especially to
be observed that the 1111101ἱ side 01 the skulh which was 0310111111Υ searched
with the help of a laryngoscope, did not show any exostoses or other
pathological changes. The finding 01 traces of plaster in the depres-
sions at the base 01 the cranium has already been mentioned above.

With regard to its general form, the cranium in question may
110 characterized as a well-shaped skull, 01 medium size. with mesati-
cephalie and chamaecephalic brain-case and relatively small 130131 ske-
leton of medium breadth.

First, in regard to the three principal dimensionsq the greatest
length (192 111111), and the greatest breadth (150 mins). may be regar-
ded as large rather than 5111311, while the diameter of the height (130
mm.) must be considered as being decidedly low. Calculating the re-
lat-ion between the above 1110301111011101115ᾖ 3 length-breadth index 01 7813
is obtained„ which places the cranium in the mesaticephalic group,
somewhat nearer the border of the brachycephaly than of the dolicho-
cephaly. The length-height index is only 67.71‚ and therefore 1110110011-
cedly chamaecephalic or platycephalic. The inconsiderable height 01
the cranium will be still more apparent 11 0110 considers the breadth-
height index, which is only Soffi.

, Judging from the given linear measurements in the several planes,
one would expect to find the horizontal circumference eomparatively
large, but the sagittal and transverse circumferences 01 about medium
size. Such is also the case: the former measurement amounts to 536
mm„ the latter are‚ respectively„ 388 and 315 mm. One may likewise
predict that the capacity 01 the brain-case will not greatly exceed the
average volume. anthupon measuring with peas, it proved to be about
1500 cub. em.

¹ The reproduction of the plaster cast of 1823 shows that the injuries 011 the alveolar
processes and on the mastoid processes partly date from the time after 11131 year. The
rest of the great injuries were already in existence when the plaster cast in question was
made. Again. the lest zygomaliC arch 011 the original 0351 seems 1011310110011111011011, before
1110 reproduetion was taken.
