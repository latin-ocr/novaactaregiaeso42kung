THE MORTAL REMAINs or Swnnnivnone 31

Of the parts of skeleton found 111 1110 cas-ket„ those belonging
to the lower extremities and the right arm were comparatively well
preserved and lay in their natural mutual position„ il' one makes allow-
ance for the slight dislocations whieh are. bound to arise when the
connection between the different bones is loosened and they sink down
in the decomposing lower layer. The bones of the trunk and the left
arm were more disintegrated: the breast 110110, 1110 clavicles7 the upper
ribs and the highest vertebrae 01 the neck had completely crumbled⁷
so that their remains, with the exception 01 1110 dens epistrophei, could
not be identified with certainty.

Among the disintegrating remains in the upper part of the
coffin were also encountered four broken pieces of the lower Jawbone7 -
which were in precisely the same condition 01 far-advanced decompo-
sition as the surrounding parts 01 1110 0110101011, i. 0.,1110 bodies 01 the eer-
vical vertebrae. The bones 01 1110 left arm, the lumbar vertebrae, the
sacrum and the left innominate bone were displaeed from their origi-
nal positions, in the direction of the above—mentioned fissure between
the bottom and the side-wall 01 1110 0011111. Some 01 the bones of 1110
hand and forearm lay in the very opening itself and outside 01 it in
the inner coffin 01 wood. Probably the left humerus„ which, as was
said, lay on top 01 the other 0011101110 111 1110 1101111-01111 011110 0011111, had
also„ on some occasion, when the leaden eoftin had been listed up,
fallen out through the fissure and afterwards been replaced in the 0011111.

Τ110 for the most part natural'position 01 1110 above-mentioned
parts of the skeleton„ belonging to the trunk and 1110 extremities, and
especially thc circumstance that evident remains= 011110 shroud still
cnveloped certain portions, especially the 1001, indicate with considerable
certainty that these partsq after thc depositing and deeoinli›ositi0n 011110
corpse7 had not at all been displaeed from their original position. Evcn
the position and condition 01 1110 fragments of the lower jaw speak
decidedly for their not having been previously taken out 0111100011111.ι

 

ance during the later years of his lise, »gray hair protrnded in every direction from under
his wig » 32 [Vol. lt, p. 403). Taking into 1⁷·onsideration the fact that the quantity 01 pigment
in the hair decreases in old age, hut does not disappear before the hair is absolutely whitey no
contradiction is involved between the appearance of the hair ‹jliseovered and the facts quoted,

¹ Still further reason for this assumption seems to lie in the fact that the lower jaw-
hone is missing in the plaster cast of 1823. Had the lower jaw been removed together with
the skull in 1816, and then been redeposited in the coftin with 11ιο latter. this· very impor-
tant part of the head would certainly also have been included in the plaster cast,
