THE MORTAL REMAINS OF Swnnm‘ssone 37

The faoi-dl skeleton appears rather small in rol-<ilion lo tho brain-
case. The nasion-basion line forms with the horizonta] line an angle
of about 2705 the profile-line again an angle of about 860, from which
it will be seen that the cranium is markedly orthognalhio. The mea-
suremenls in the middle plane (compare Table I.) show no noleworlhy
divergenees from the usual condition. The pterion is of normal appear—
ance with almost altogether obliterated sutures.

The tempora] plane shows a rather evideni fossa alaris (SCHWALBE
28), bounded by prominenees of which, especially on the left side>
the superior frontal (corresponding to the 3rd frontal gyrus) is fairly well
