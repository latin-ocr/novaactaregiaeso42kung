The circumstances discussed above seem to prove beyond a
doubt the possibility that the skull and lower maxilla are from the samo
individual„ and even in 501110 measure to argue for the probability that
such 15 1110 ease. Any positive efficieney as proofs can, neverffieless,
hardly be ascribed to the above 011011111510111005ἢ as the question was
only concerning the general characters 01 the maxillae, which in this
ease did not differ greatly fron] the ordinary type.

An argument 01 11111011 greater value may7 however, be extraeted
from the relation 01 1110 teeth. Attention has already been called above
to the laet that the skull in question, at the time when the plaster
cast was taken„ in the year 182:3,>still retained the right eye-moth,
that 115 orown was worn off almost all the way to the root, and that
it showed two facets of detrition facing obliquely outwards. I 0011-

clusion, that the cranium had a more than usually protruding lower

as the incisors⁷ 01 1110 upper jaW„ jut somewhat forewards over the row
of teeth in the lower jaw, for which reason they are only slightly sub-
jected to (1011111011, and this principally on their inner side. 37 But it is
not less important in this connection, that the far-advanced wearing

find that this exactly answers to the demands just made, for it still pre-
