sufficient to rel'er to the above-stated data regarding Baroness 1οΝ
Nouam, the particular conditions of the 111011, as well as the ex—officer
GRANHOLM'S needy condition. to rob these objections of their force.

cf more weight„ however„ are the doubts„ 11111011111110110111111110
to time been expressed regarding the genuineness of that cranium which
was replaced in the 0011111 111101 1110 111011. An idea of this kind first
appears in the minutes 01 1110 001111011 of the Swedish Church in London
for November 10111, 1811, (Appendfx, No. 7), where it is reported that
a Mr. IN DE BETOU„1 during an inventi-»ry 011110 1111111, had carcfully in-
spected the slfflll in SWEDENBoRe's 0011111, and that he had found grounds
for doubting its identity, »1) 1100111130 within the head is a quantity of
111131, 11111011 would seem 10 show that the skuli had lain in the earth,
2) because a piece 01 wood is to be 30011, driven into the 1101111, which
seems 10 indicate that the dead man had lost his life in some violent
manner, and 3) because there is no mark to show that any cast had
been taken 01 1110 11100, 113 13 stated 111 1110 minutes for ‚July 4111, 1819,
§8st ff This examination had evidently not been conducted with suf-
ficient 01110, 101, as will be further shown in what 10110113, the de-
pressions at the base of the sl<ull‚ without any doubt the same era-
nium examined in 1908, were found to eontain unquestionable traces
of gypsum. lt. may easily be supposed, under such 011011111311111003,
that the »dustm referred to as being within the skull, was mouldered
and dried up brain substance„ which is not infrequently 01 11 00101
and camsistency resembling actual dust. Again, as regards the piece
of wood„ it is possible that this was used when GRANHOLM cleaned
the cranium⁷ or when the plaster cast was takeng in any case no in-
jury was observed during our examination of the cranium whose na-
ture made it probable that it had arisen on account of 301110 violence
undergone during life. The causes presented by IN DE BETOU are thus
in no wisc sufficient to give occasion to the suspicion that the cranium
was a substitute.
