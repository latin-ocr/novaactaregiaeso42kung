THE MORTAL REMAINs or SWEDENEORG 9

HAwffiNs’ very brief narration does not disolose anything further
than what has been recounted⁷ except that the stranger was a learned
Swede, and that the lid of the coffin was only laid on without being
fastened again. Ἰ

Some few days after the event just described, a new visit was
made to the vault by five or six members of the New Churoh. HIND-
amasa, who was himself present, relates concerning this visit that after
having assured themselves by the inscription that the casket contained
SWEDENBoae’s corpse„ the coffin was opened‚ upon which it was found
that »the features were still perfectv7 the flesh firm and the whole coun-
tenance» sufficiently well preserved to enable the observers to oon-
firm its absolute similarity to SWEDENBORG'S portrait. When ΗΙΝΙ)ἒ
MARsH »plac-ed his hand on the foreheach he observed that the lower
part of the nose gave indications of approaohing decomposition.» »It
was afterwards found ..... that the whole frame was speedily be-
ing reduced to ashes.»

As to whether SWEDENBORe's coffin was again at any time open-
ed and examined during the years that elapsed until 1816, we know
nothing, only that the vault was opencd at least nine times to receive
new coffins. It is olear, however3 that it was the thoughtless opening
of SWEDENBORG“S ooftin about the year 1790„ and the imperfect closing
of the same, which made possible the theft in 1816 of the cranium, of
which in the following chapter.
