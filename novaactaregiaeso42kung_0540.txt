There is, however„ no reason ie suppose that the remains of
SWEDENHORG had been distin-bed prior te about the year 1790, when his
coffin was opened. and this merely to satisfy the curiosity of some un-
authorized persons, There are several accounts coneerning this occur-
rence, which agree in the inest essential features: minor deviatione in
the matter ef details being easily explained by the fact that all the
accounts are based upon second-hand inserinalien. and all have been
written down quite a long tinie after the event took place.
