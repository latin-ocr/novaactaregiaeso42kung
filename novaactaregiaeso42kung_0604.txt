as having been SWEDENBORG'S.

The skull, which is in the collini is undoubtedly identieal
with lli-<it skull. which⁷ after u plaster east had been taken„
according to truetworth)⁷ stateiiiente, was deposited in the eoffin
in 1823.

The anatomicam investigation of the skuli and the exa-
mination of its ph ysiognomieal characters, an aeeount of whieh
is given in the latter part of this work, have led to the following sate
eonelusions:

Neither the state ot* preservation of the skuli, nor its
general fornii its characters ot¹ sex und age„ and anthropologi-
eal ine-<isin'e1nentsy ean be advuneed as testimony against its
being genuine„but‚ on the contrary, tho)v are in full agreement
with ‚such a supposition.

The dimensione and general form ot' the preserved ge-
nuine lower jawbone, and especially the condition ot main-
tenanee and arrangement of its teeth and alveolffl· proeesse&
are in the best harinony with the corresponding parte¹ of the
skuli (and the east ot' 1823) and consequently afford a very
good argument for their belonging together.

particularly the dimensional relations between the different
parts of tho lace. in so far as they appear on viewing the
skuli, oi· by means of the plaetic reconstruetion, show no im-
portant divergenee froin the existing lilienesses of SWEDEN-
BORG‚ bui, on the contrary, these oller-stetere of the skull7 as
to various points, speak in favor of its having been SWEDEN-
BORG’S.
