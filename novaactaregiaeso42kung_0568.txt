There is therefore no reason whatever to doubt that the above-men-
tioned parts of the skeleton really are those of EMANUEL 811111-
DENBORG. Neither by the historical examination, nor by the close
anatomical investigation, has any fact been discovered, which can be
considered to be opposed to such a conclusion.

Again, as regards the 6111111, this„ as was said. had 116 place at
the head-end of 1110 0011111, above the rest of the 0011161116 and resting
011 its basal surface 111111 1116 100101 portion turned in 1116 (1116011011 01
1116 coffin's head—end. It was relatively well preserved and exhibited
neither 011 1116 inside or outside any remnants 01 inouldered substance
worthy 01 mention: on the other hand, in 1110 ‹lepressions 01 1116 6111111
were observed evident traces of gypsum.

These conditions are quite satisfactorily explained by the histo-
rical facts which have been discussed above. The less advanced de-
001111106111011 01 1116 6111111 111011Υ 116 ascribed 10 1116 fact that the cranium,
which had not lain in the 0011111 during the years fron] 181610 1823,110(1
been less subjected 10 the inssuence of (1011111 air and surrounding decay-
ing matter than the other bones (for instance the lower 1011γ and cervical
vertebrae) which lay in the same part 01 1116 0011111. The absence of
decaying matter which adhercd 10 other parts 01 1116 6116161011, inay be ex-
plained by the skull's having at some time been cleaned, and 1116 pre-
sence 01 gypsum by the fact that a plaster cast had been made in 1823.

It appears froin what has been said above, that the observations
made when the coffin was opened do not 111 any point disputc, but, on
the contrary, may 116 considered to confirm those 00110111610116 10 which
1110 historical investigations have led„ but nevcrtheless the chief point
itself, namely, whether an exchange of the cranium could possibly
have occurred before 1823, has not thereby been brought 11110 clearer
light. It was therefore necessary 10 undertake a 1111111116 0001011110οΙ
examination of the skull, in order, if possible, 10 find some positive
proofs, 01· at least some further grounds 01 probability, for 1116 suppo-
sition that it had actually been SWEDENBORG'S, or — 11 not, to get some
proofs to the contrary.

For this purpose the cranium and the reinains 01 1116 lower 11011*-
110110 were taken the same day to the Anatoniical Institution in Upsala,
where ineasurenients were made and photographs and plaster 00616
taken. After this had been accoinplished the objects were taken back
to Upsala (lathedrz‘tl on June 13111 aud deposited in 1110 0011111, which
was 111611 closed and sealed. (Ἀρρεηιῖίλῑ, Nos. 14 and 15⁴).
