THE MORTAL Rmmms OF SWEDENBORG 61

Still more illustrative results are obtained by the method of re-
construction, by which 0110, 50 10 speak. clothes the bony frame anew
with its enveloping layers 01 511111, 1111150105 and other 5011 parts.

Apart from the paleontologists' attempts tc reconstruct the soft
parts 011 1110 skeletons 01 105511 animals„ to thus gain an approximate
conception 01 the shape and proportions 01 these animals during life,
this method has first been used by W. His 11 &- 13 for the purpose
01 identifying the skull 01 -JOHANN SEBAsTIAN BAcH. ln 11115 case it was
desired, while digging for building operations in the st. -Johannis 0110Γο11-
yard in Leipsic‚ 1894„ tc try to find the forgctten burial place 01 ΒΑΟΗ,
and to secure any remains which might be preserved. Guided by certain
old statements, suspicions had been directed tc a special place and a
particular skeletom for which reason a minute examination of the cra-
nium belonging 10 11 was entered upon. After this examinaticn had
brought to light that the skull„ in point 01 age, sexa etc, might be the
genuine one„ His commissioned the sculptor (Γ. SEFFNER to model a
bust 01 BACH upon a plaster cast 01 1110 cranium, with the guidance 01
existing poi‘traits„ and taking especial care that the layer 01 clay corre-
sponding to the 5011 parts should haye a thickness in agreement with
established anatomical measurements. The experiment was a complete
success, rendering a highly important support to the supposition that
the skull really was BACH's.

The plastic reconstruetiye method has. 50 far as I know, on no
other occasion served for the direct identification of crania¹‚ but it was
used by KOLLMANN 14 on a cranium 01 1110 stone-age„ by FURST 7 ΟΠ
a mediaeval skull. and by MERKEL 18 011 a preliistoric and an Australian
skull, chietly in order 10 control the practicability 011110 method.v which„
moreoyer, has been further developed and perfected especially by KOLL-
MANN. According to his directions. which I principally followed7 there
are built7 011 certain fixed 511015 011 a plaster cast 01 1110 cranium·7 little
pyramids 01 plaster whose height must be in exact agreement with
the average thickness 01 1110 5011 covering in the correspomling places.
at'ter which the 5011 parts are modelled in clay or some other plastic
material7 strict care being taken that the points indicated by the tcps
01 the pyramids shall lie level with the surtace 01 1110 future image.

In order 10 make use 01 11115 1110111011, 0110 must know the thick-
ness of the 5011 covering parts on 1110 varicus regions ot' the head.
