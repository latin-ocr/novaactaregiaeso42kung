mission on Saturday, to . . „simated about . . . kilometers from Lon-
don, Mr, R. stated, when, after much difficulty, it was possible to ob-
tain an interview with him, that he had seen, in 1869, at an antiquary’s
in the East End 01 London, a skull which the said dealer declared was
SWEDENBORG'S, and which he was supposed to have bought from a grave-
digger, who had found it when some coffins in the Swedish churchyard
were moved. Mr. R. would, however, under no considerations, disclose
the name 01 11110 now deceased antiquary, or 01 1110 000, but explained
that 110 0011111 only find him if he himself, accompanied by two ward-
0110, 0011111 travel 10 London to make his investigations.

»The physician at 1110 institution where Mr. R. 10 0011110011, said
that it would be absolutely impossible to find 0111 whether these state-
ments 01 Μ1. R. were true 01 only based on the circumstance 01 his
having perhaps at some time heard the 111011 ofSWEDENBoRG’s cranium
spoken of and thereupon constructed this story 10 find 001110 excuse
for getting out of the asylum.» ι

When, therefore, there seemed to be 110 possibility 01 getting
any anthentic information concerning SwEDENBORe's skull from this
source, the Minister in London considered that nothing could 101 1110
present be done for the solution 01 1110 problem.

The information thus derived 0001110, however, to be sufficient
10 reduce to a minimum the value 01 Μ1. R‘s account. 11 10, namely,
in the 11101 place clear that Mr. H„ because 01 1110 insanity, can in
no wise be considered as a reliable witness, and that there is direct
cause to suppose that his story may have been fab1·icated. But even
11 we assume that his statements are based 011 facts, and that a cer-
tain antiquz‘uy, about 1870, had himself been convinced that he was in
the possession of SwEDENBORe's skull, the more particular details of the
story make it most improbable that it was the genuine skull. The
grave-digger must, namely, 11 this were the case, either have stolen
11 before 1816 and have laid in its place another, which in its turn had
been taken by GRANHom, or 0100, 111 001110 way, 110 had come 11110 pos-
session 01 the genuine skull, 0101011 by GRANHOLM, in the place 01 which
either the last-named, or Pastor WAHLm, 01 Μ1. TULK had procures]
another cranium which was deposIted in the easket in 1823. After
1823, as above shown, it is absolutely certain that no exchange has
taken place. lt therefore appears much inore prob-able (110-31111011, Mr.
Rfs story be correct) that the grave-(ligger had deluded the old anti-
quary into buying a false skull.
