THE MORTAL REMAINS oF SWEDENBORG 51

stion of GALL's doofrine have fo some extent been supported by later
rese-arches, (MOEBIOE 19 Δ(111(1 λῐΈΒΒΑσΗ 1), for the facts here mentioned
to be regarded as an argument that the cranium 15 that of SWE-
DENBORG.

Our investigaiion of 1116 general characters of the oraniun] has
consequently not yielded any direct proof of its geliiiiiielieSS‚ which„
for that matter. eould hardly be expected. The only positive conclusion
we can make is that 1116 skuli is that of a man advanoed in years:
but on 1116 other hand nothing was enoonn'tered to stand in the way
of his being of Swedish nationalify and possessing apreeniinent genius.
nithe-rto no facts have 601116 to light which contradict the
supposition that the cranium is that of EMANUEL SWEDENBORG.
